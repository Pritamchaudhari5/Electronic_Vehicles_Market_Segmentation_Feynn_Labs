### Market Segmentation

Market segmentation is a strategic marketing approach that involves identifying and categorizing groups of consumers with distinct characteristics, interests, purchasing power, and consumer preferences. This approach recognizes that not all customers are the same and tailors product offerings and marketing strategies to appeal to specific consumer segments. Market segmentation is a critical strategy for businesses, as it allows them to allocate resources more efficiently and effectively, focusing their efforts on target customers rather than attempting to appeal to all potential buyers broadly.

### Problem Statement

The objective is to conduct a segmentation analysis to analyze the Online Vehicle Booking Market in India and develop a viable market entry strategy that targets the segments most likely to use the product. This analysis will encompass Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic, and Behavioral factors to pinpoint the most promising customer segments for the business.
